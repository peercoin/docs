## Compiling

### Compiling packages for Debian and Ubuntu

As Peercoin is made to run on range of platforms, from Amazon's server to low powered Raspberry Pi Debian is perfect OS platform for deploying Peercoin nodes as it is renowned for multitude of supported hardware architectures as well as security and stability.

For compilation of Debian packages we will be using `pbuilder` which is a automatic Debian Package Building system for personal development workstation environments.<sup>[3.1](#footnote-3.1)</sup> pbuilder aims to be an easy-to-setup system for auto-building Debian packages inside a clean-room environment, so that it is possible to verify that a package can be built on most Debian installations. The clean-room environment is achieved through the use of a base chroot image, so that only minimal packages will be installed inside the chroot.

The following tutorial is written for the Ubuntu or Debian host, precisely Ubuntu 17.10 which is last stable version of Ubuntu at the time of writing.

### Prepare the tooling

`sudo apt install pbuilder qemu-user-static ubuntu-keyring debian-archive-keyring`

We'll also need keyring for the Raspbian, which a Debian fork made for the Raspberry Pi platform, so we can compile packages for this ARM based mini-pc platform.

> wget http://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian/pool/main/r/raspbian-archive-keyring/raspbian-archive-keyring_20120528.2_all.deb

> sudo dpkg -i raspbian-archive-keyring_20120528.2_all.deb

Now, set up the conf file for the pbuilder.

`touch .pbuilderrc`

> gedit .pbuilderrc

Paste the following:

```
#!/bin/sh

set -e

```

Make the directory where pbuilder will place the packages:

`mkdir -p $HOME/pbuild-results`

### Bootstrap the chroots

Raspbian (buster):

> sudo OS=raspbian DIST=buster ARCH=armhf pbuilder --create

Debian stable:

> sudo OS=debian DIST=buster ARCH=amd64 pbuilder --create

### Preparing for build

(compiling for Raspbian stretch in this example)

Download the latest .tar.gz from github.com/peercoin.

> wget https://github.com/peercoin/peercoin/releases/download/v0.11.0ppc/peercoin-0.11.0.tar.gz

Debian build system is very strict about names, so we need to rename this to:

`peercoin_0.11.0.orig.tar.gz`

Extract the contests of the file using `tar xf` and `cd` to it.

Copy the debian directory from the contrib to this directory:

`cp -r contrib/debian .`

#### Some modifications

(this is just an extra step required for the Raspbian, to fix problem with autotools)

`sed '/./configure --with-gui=qt5 --with-incompatible-bdb/s/$/ --with-boost-libdir=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/' debian/rules`

### Building the package

`OS=raspbian DIST=stretch ARCH=armhf pdebuild`

And wait, it will take a while so go get a coffee or something. It's compiling by emulating ARM cpu in QEMU.

The concept of pbuild and cross-platform compilations is that you pass it this environment variables like "OS" and "DIST".

For example OS=debian and DIST=wheezy will use Debian Wheezy chroot, you can also pick architecture by using ARCH= environment variable.

## JSON-RPC API reference

Peercoin daemon offers JSON-RPC interface which can be used to control the daemon or integrate it with software stack.
You can send commands to the daemon by using `peercoin-cli` tool.

There are two official wrappers for this interface, a PHP one and a Python2.7+ one.

> Peercoin_rpc is a simple and minimal library made for communication with peercoind via JSON-RPC protocol. It has a single dependency - a Python requests library and it supports both mainnet and testnet peercoin network with authentication or SSL encryption. There is a single class to be imported from the library - Client.

https://github.com/peercoin/peercoin_rpc

> peercoin-php-rpc is a simple and minimal library made for communication with peercoind via JSON-RPC protocol for PHP 7.1+. Easiest way to use is to use composer. Otherwise include RpcClient class in your project an you are good to go.

## Transaction format

Peercoin transaction format is indendical to a Bitcoin transaction format with the exception of included transaction timestamp.

| Property | Description | Bytes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Version  | transaction version number | 4 |
| Timestamp | transaction timestamp | 4 |
| Input-counter | number of transaction inputs | 1-9 |
| List of inputs | list of transaction inputs | varies |
| Output-counter | number of transaction outputs | 1-9 |
| List of outputs | list of transaction outputs | varies |
| Locktime | block number or Unix timestamp when the transaction finalizes | 4 |


As of Peercoin 0.11, timestamp is no longer required and transaction format is exactly the same as Bitcoin. The only exception is that `version` is now `3`.

| Property | Description | Bytes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Version  | transaction version number | 4 |
| Input-counter | number of transaction inputs | 1-9 |
| List of inputs | list of transaction inputs | varies |
| Output-counter | number of transaction outputs | 1-9 |
| List of outputs | list of transaction outputs | varies |
| Locktime | block number or Unix timestamp when the transaction finalizes | 4 |


## Bootstrapping

### What is it?

> In computer technology the term (usually shortened to booting) usually
> refers to the process of loading the basic software into the memory of
> a computer after power-on or general reset, especially the operating
> system which will then take care of loading other software as needed.<sup>[9.1](#footnote-9.1)</sup>

For Peercoin it means loading all of the block chain history from a special
file containing a snapshot of block data.

This special file, named `bootstrap.dat`, allows the Peercoin client to
sync from your hard drive instead of the internet. Using a
`bootstrap.dat` file is faster and reduces stress on the Peercoin network to sync new nodes.

### How do I make a `bootstrap.dat`?

Any synced client has the ability to make a `bootstrap.dat` file. Assuming
you're running linux you can do the following to manufacture your own.
First, shutdown your client. Allow it to cleanly exit so we know the block
data is settled.

Now, navigate to the directory `~/.peercoin/blocks` in your terminal and
notice the files named `blk00000.dat`, `blk00001.dat`, `blk00002.dat`, etc.
These are the raw block data files that can be combined to form the
`bootstrap.dat`!

The command:
> cat blk*.dat > bootstrap.dat

will produce the `bootstrap.dat`.
The file is often then compressed (zip'ed, tar/gzip'ed) and shared.

The same process can be executed on Microsoft Windows (7+):

> CD C:\Users\<my_user>\AppData\Roaming\Peercoin

> COPY /b blk0001.dat+blk0002.dat bootstrap.dat

Or on OS X:

> cd "~/Library/Application Support/Peercoin/"

> cat blk*.dat > bootstrap.dat


On linux and OS X you can create hash of the bootstrap:

> sha256 bootstrap.dat

### How do I use a `bootstrap.dat`?

Assuming you're on linux and you haven't started the Peercoin client before.

Make the directory `~/.peercoin` if it doesn't exist and then move the
`bootstrap.dat` into the `~/.peercoin` directory.

Start the Peercoin client. You should see the status `Importing blocks from disk...` if the client has found the `bootstrap.dat` and is using it to
sync the block chain.

### Where can I download a `bootstrap.dat`?

We've put some recent copies on our [file server](https://files.peercoin.net) :)
