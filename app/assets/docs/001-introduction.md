# Introduction to Peercoin

Hello, and welcome to the Peercoin Documentation website. We hope to help you understand more about Peercoin, its philosophy, and the technology that defines it. Before getting too technical, we invite you to dive a little bit into the history of Peercoin, learning why it was created, and the purposes behind it.

The key innovation of Peercoin is the invention of Proof-of-Stake, a blockchain consensus protocol that provides efficient, sustainable security and user governance, allowing for a decentralized cryptocurrency network with a sane economic model and a core focus on security and sustainability.

## Peercoin Genesis: 2012

Since the creation of Bitcoin (Nakamoto 2008), Proof-of-Work has been the dominant design for security and distribution of peer-to-peer cryptocurrencies.  In 2012, Sunny King and Scott Nadal proposed an alternative form of consensus that remedied the energy inefficiencies of Bitcoin as well as improving the long-term decentralization of the system.   Proof-of-Work mining trends toward centralization due to the increased profits and production from large scale mining operations.  Proof-of-Stake, on the other hand, provides sustainable decentralization by allowing for a consensus protocol that can be run from a home computer without specialized hardware or massive energy use.  Instead of electricity and computing power, time and value invested in the system (coin age) is consumed to verify transactions, resolving many of the issues plaguing Proof-of-Work consensus.  To bootstrap the coin distribution, the intrinsic competition of Proof-of-Work is used alongside the security model of Proof-of-Stake to provide a fair and balanced system with no premine or initial coin offering. Proof-of-Stake safeguards the blockchain while a dynamic Proof-of-Work reward continues Peercoin's fair distribution model, resulting in an estimated 1-3% inflation each year for a practical long-term sustainable economic model.

Since its first block in 2012, Peercoin has remained one of the most energy efficient, secure, and size effective blockchains in existence. Many projects have picked up the torch of using Proof-of-Stake or its derivatives, and all can be traced back to Peercoin's original model. The efficient security of Peercoin naturally acts as a backbone layer, simplifying the deployment of future scaling solutions.

## Peercoin University

[Peercoin university](https://university.peercoin.net/) is a community project aimed at less technical members of the community to grasp and understand the complex topic of public blockchain.
